      answer: `I'm a data scientist with a biotech background who stumbled into ML and never looked back. I build things end-to-end — from messy raw data to a working pipeline — and I bring a research mindset to engineering problems. That means I don't just run a model, I actually want to know <em>why</em> it's doing what it's doing.<br><br>
Right now I'm steering hard toward AI/ML engineering — building and deploying intelligent systems at scale, not just notebooks. My background is unusual: I've read gene expression papers, worked in a biofilm lab, published 12+ papers at IEEE and Springer, and built fraud detection pipelines on 10M+ claim records at Cigna. That cross-domain range is probably the most underrated thing about how I work.<br><br>
<strong>The thread:</strong> healthcare ML, bioinformatics, cloud engineering, NLP, Bayesian modelling — all of it connects because I want to work on problems where the data is complex, the stakes are real, and the answer actually matters to someone.<br><br>

The thing I'm most proud of there is building the composite risk scoring framework. I engineered 40+ features from 10M+ claim records, designed a log-scaled and percentile-normalised scoring layer, and made the output interpretable enough for fraud investigators to actually act on it — surfaced through a Power BI dashboard. The pipeline contributed to an estimated <strong>$400K–$700K in potential savings</strong> and improved detection coverage by 20%.<br><br>
The model accuracy was one part of it. Building something a human can pick up and immediately know what to investigate — that was the harder and more important part.${contactLine()}`,

In healthcare AI, bioinformatics, and fraud detection — the data has context that a pure CS background doesn't come with.

I had to design the detection framework from scratch: define what anomalous looked like, engineer features that made those patterns visible, and build a scoring layer investigators could trust.

I had to design the output so a claim's risk score was immediately interpretable: what's flagged, why it's flagged, and what to look at first. That meant translating percentile-normalised composite scores into plain priority tiers.<br><br>

      answer: `<strong>Atherosclerosis</strong> is the hardening and narrowing of arteries due to plaque buildup — fats, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances accumulating on arterial walls over time. It often begins forming in childhood and worsens silently for decades.<br><br>
The consequences are severe: restricted blood flow can cause <strong>heart attack, stroke, vascular dementia, and heart failure</strong>. Atherosclerosis-linked diseases are the leading cause of death globally. Risk factors include high LDL cholesterol, hypertension, Type 2 diabetes, smoking, and genetic predisposition.<br><br>
This is directly relevant to my research — my gene clustering work found that <strong>CD4, CXCL10, and FMO3</strong> are dysregulated at the intersection of T2D and atherosclerosis. These immune checkpoint genes point to an inflammatory pathway linking diabetes to cardiovascular disease — which has real implications for therapeutic targeting.`,

      answer: `<strong>Type 2 Diabetes (T2D)</strong> is a chronic metabolic disorder — accounting for ~90% of all diabetes cases — where the body's cells become resistant to insulin. The pancreas initially compensates by producing more insulin, but gradually loses capacity, causing blood sugar to rise dangerously.<br><br>
The systemic effects are far-reaching: T2D patients face <strong>2–4x increased cardiovascular risk</strong>, plus microvascular damage causing retinopathy (vision loss), nephropathy (kidney failure), and neuropathy (nerve damage). It's not just a blood sugar problem — it reshapes the entire inflammatory and metabolic landscape.<br><br>
My bioinformatics research sits right at this intersection: I studied the gene expression overlap between T2D and atherosclerosis using GEO dataset GSE57329. The hub genes I identified — <strong>CD4, CXCL10, FMO3</strong> — are immune regulators, suggesting that the T2D → cardiovascular disease pathway runs through immune dysregulation, not just metabolic dysfunction.

If there's a specific lab working on biomedical AI at a scale that only a PhD gives you access to — foundation models for clinical data, large-scale genomics — I'd seriously consider it. But I'm not doing a PhD to collect a credential. I'd only do it if the research itself demanded it.`,

The judging is split: quality of research and quality of communication. You're presenting to a mixed audience — technical reviewers and people who just need to follow the argument. That balance is something I've worked hard on. The best research in the room doesn't win if the presenter can't make the stakes clear to someone who didn't come in knowing the domain.<br><br>
That lesson carries directly into how I design dashboards and present model results at work.`,

I write to understand — if I can't explain something clearly in plain language, I don't really understand it yet. The T2DM molecular research post forced me to trace the whole signalling pathway before I could write a sentence that made sense. That process made me better at the actual research.<br><br>

In biotech that was gene expression and disease pathways. In data science that was fraud detection and clinical risk prediction. In AI engineering, that's building the systems that take those models and make them reliable, scalable, and deployable.<br><br>

At Cigna, the thing that mattered wasn't the accuracy number — it was whether the fraud investigator could act on the output. That gap between model and impact is an engineering problem. I want to close that gap.<br><br>

      answer: `Chess trained me to think a few moves ahead and to not fall in love with my first idea.<br><br>
In ML work that shows up as: before I commit to a modelling approach, I map out what could go wrong — data drift, label imbalance, deployment constraints. It's the same instinct as not playing the obvious move without checking what it opens up for the opponent.<br><br>
The other thing chess teaches is that the post-game analysis after a loss is as valuable as the game itself. I bring that same post-mortem instinct to failed experiments and false starts in ML.`,
